#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    double start_time = omp_get_wtime();  // Start timing

#pragma omp parallel
    {
        printf("Hello from thread %d\n", omp_get_thread_num());
    }

    double end_time = omp_get_wtime();  // End timing

    printf("Execution Time: %.6f seconds\n", end_time - start_time);

    return 0;
}



expected output but it gives random threads:

Hello from thread 1
Hello from thread 4
Hello from thread 2
Hello from thread 3
Hello from thread 0
Hello from thread 6
Hello from thread 10
Hello from thread 5
Hello from thread 8
Hello from thread 9
Hello from thread 7
Hello from thread 11

Execution Time: 0.023000 seconds (Time differs)
