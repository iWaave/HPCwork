Why is TSP NP-Hard?
No Polynomial-Time Solution Exists:

As the number of cities increases, the time required to compute the exact solution grows exponentially. This is called combinatorial explosion.
Examples of Time Complexity Growth:

For 3 cities: 3! = 6 routes
For 4 cities: 4! = 24 routes
For 10 cities: 10! = 3,628,800 routes
For n cities: n! (factorial time complexity)
Verifying vs. Solving:

If you were given a candidate solution (a specific route), you could calculate its total distance in polynomial time. But finding the optimal route among all possible ones is where the problem becomes NP-Hard.





Practical Example of TSP
Scenario
Imagine a salesman needs to visit 4 cities:

A (starting point)
B
C
D

The distances between cities are represented in the table below:

From → To	A	B	C	D
     A	        0	10	15	20
     B	        10	0	35	25
     C	        15	35	0	30
     D	        20	25	30	0

Step 1: List All Possible Routes
For 4 cities, the possible routes are:

A → B → C → D → A
A → B → D → C → A
A → C → B → D → A
A → C → D → B → A
A → D → B → C → A
A → D → C → B → A


Step 2: Calculate Total Distance for Each Route
For each route, calculate the total distance:

A → B → C → D → A = 10 (A→B) + 35 (B→C) + 30 (C→D) + 20 (D→A) = 95
A → B → D → C → A = 10 (A→B) + 25 (B→D) + 30 (D→C) + 15 (C→A) = 80
A → C → B → D → A = 15 (A→C) + 35 (C→B) + 25 (B→D) + 20 (D→A) = 95
A → C → D → B → A = 15 (A→C) + 30 (C→D) + 25 (D→B) + 10 (B→A) = 80
A → D → B → C → A = 20 (A→D) + 25 (D→B) + 35 (B→C) + 15 (C→A) = 95
A → D → C → B → A = 20 (A→D) + 30 (D→C) + 35 (C→B) + 10 (B→A) = 95


Step 3: Identify the Shortest Route
From the calculations above, the shortest routes are:

A → B → D → C → A with a total distance of 80
A → C → D → B → A with a total distance of 80
